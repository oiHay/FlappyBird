<h3>This is a study project for the course: "Oficina Indie"</h3>
<br>
<p>The main goal of this project was to recreate the core functionality of the infamous game Flappy Bird.
<br>
I then decided to extend the project by adding:
</p>
<li>A main menu</li>
<li>A settings menu</li>
<li>A death menu</li>
<li>A tutorial</li>
<li>a high score "board"</li>
<br>
<p>I used the "UI Toolkit" native to Unity for all the UI in the game, as a test and learning challenge.</p>
