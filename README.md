<h3>This is a study project for the course: "Oficina Indie"</h3>
<br>
The main goal of this project was to recreate the core functionality of the infamous game Flappy Bird.

I then decided to extend the project by adding:
- A main menu
- A transition scene (scene loader).
- A settings menu
- a high score board
- A tutorial
- Death menu

I used the "UI Toolkit" native to Unity for all the UI in the game, as a test and learning challenge.
